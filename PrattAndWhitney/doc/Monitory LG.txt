================

When monitors connected via Daisy Chain (that
controls multiple monitors) are turned off and
on successively, some monitors may not turn
on. In this case, you can turn those monitors on
by pressing the MONITOR ON button, not the
POWER button.

Transmission/Reception Protocol

Transmission

[Command1][Command2][ ][Set ID][ ][Data][Cr]

* [Command1]: identifies between the factory setting and the user setting modes.

* [Command2]: controls monitor sets.

* [Set ID]: Used for selecting a set you want to control. A unique Set ID can be assigned to each set ranging from 1 to 1000(01H~3E8H) under Settings in the OSD menu. Selecting ‘00H’ for Set ID allows the simultaneous control of all connected monitors. (The maximum value may differ depending on the model.)

* [Data]: Transmits command data. Data count may increase depending on the command.

* [Cr]: Carriage Return. Corresponds to ‘0x0D’ in ASCII code.

* [ ]: White Space. Corresponds to ‘0x20’ in ASCII code.

------------------

Acknowledgement

[Command2][ ][Set ID][ ][OK/NG][Data][x]

* The Product transmits ACK (acknowledgement) based on this format when receiving normal data. At this time, if the data is FF, it indicates the present status data. If the data is in data write mode, it returns the data of the PC computer.

* If a command is sent with Set ID ‘00’ (=0x00), the data is reflected to all monitor sets and each monitor set does not send an acknowledgement (ACK).

* If the data value ‘FF’ is sent in control mode via RS-232C, the current setting value of a function can be checked (only for some functions).

*Some commands are not supported depending on the model.

===================

01. Power (Command: k a)

Controls the power on/off of the set.

Acknowledgement

[a][ ][Set ID][ ][OK/NG][Data][x]

*The acknowledgement signal is returned properly only when
the monitor is fully powered on.

* There may be a delay between the transmission and
acknowledgement signals.
